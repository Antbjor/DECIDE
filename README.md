#### Way of working according to Essence
Our team is currently in the "In place" state. All team members are using the agreed upon tools
and formatting guidelines to do work. To get to the "Working well" state, the team needs to get more used
to writing and performing tests with the tools we are using. In our current state we are still getting used to
the tools and practices.
